# 🟩 **Replit AI Prompt – Online Turf Booking, Matchmaking & Ranking System (Football Theme)**

**You are to build a full-stack, football-themed web application.
This system must include a User Portal and a Turf Admin Portal.
The website design, UI components, colors, icons, and layout must strictly follow a FOOTBALL THEME (greens, whites, turf patterns, scoreboard fonts, football icons, etc).**

## ✅ **Project: Intelligent Turf Booking, Team Matchmaking & Ranking System**

### **📌 Main Objective**

Build a complete web application that solves the following complex computing problem:

> “Design and implement an intelligent Turf Booking, Team Matchmaking, and Ranking Management System that automatically pairs teams, manages tournament advertising, and maintains a dynamic team ranking using match history.”

---

## 🧩 **Core Functional Requirements**

### **1. Online Turf Booking System**

* Users browse turfs with real-time slot availability
* Users book turf slots
* Prevent double-booking using **interval scheduling algorithm**
* Handle overlapping time conflicts
* FCFS or priority rule for simultaneous booking requests
* Admin can manage slots, cancel bookings, approve bookings

---

### **2. Intelligent Opponent Finder (Matchmaking System)**

Build a matchmaking engine that matches Team A with Team B using:

* ELO ranking similarity
* Location preference
* Turf type preference
* Availability
* Past match history

Use **weighted scoring or graph-based matchmaking**.

---

### **3. Dynamic Team Ranking Engine**

Implement:

* ELO-based rating system
* Rating updates after every match
* Tier system (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum)
* Handle new teams with no match history
* Season-based ranking
* Performance analytics (wins, losses, goals for/against)

---

### **4. Tournament Management & Advertisement Engine**

Users + turf owners can:

* Create tournament ads
* Promote events and turf deals

System must:

* Recommend ads using content-based + collaborative filtering
* Prevent duplicate/spam ads
* Rank ads by interest, locality, team history

---

### **5. Database Requirements**

Store:

* Teams
* Users
* Turf info
* Match history
* ELO ratings
* Tournament ads
* Bookings
* User preferences

Database must be optimized for:

* High-concurrency booking
* Fast matchmaking
* Complex ranking queries
* Reporting and analytics

Use PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

---

## 🧠 **Core Algorithms (MUST IMPLEMENT)**

* Interval Scheduling Algorithm (avoid double bookings)
* Greedy Scheduling for conflict resolution
* ELO Rating Algorithm
* Weighted Matchmaking Algorithm
* Recommendation Algorithm (ads/tournaments)

---

## 🎨 **UI/Theme Requirements (Football Theme)**

* Green turf backgrounds
* Football icons, pitch lines, scoreboards
* Team cards styled like player profile cards
* Live scoreboard-style match history
* Turf map with green shaded fields
* Admin dashboard in football theme
* Mobile responsive design

---

## 🛠 **Technical Requirements**

* Full-stack (Node.js / Express / Python Flask / Next.js — choose best)
* Authentication for users + admins
* Role-based dashboards
* REST API or GraphQL
* Real-time notifications (WebSockets preferred)
* Clean folder structure
* Reusable components
* Well-commented code

---

## 🎯 **Final Output Expected From Replit AI**

Generate:

* Complete full-stack codebase
* Football-themed UI
* Turf Admin Portal + User Portal
* Matchmaking + ELO engine implementation
* Tournament Ad system
* Database schema + migrations
* API routes
* Working scheduling + ranking algorithms
* Dashboard pages
* Testing + seed data

---

# ⚽ **Important Note to Replit AI**

**EVERYTHING must follow FOOTBALL VISUAL THEME.
All UI pages must look like a football app/turf booking platform.
Do not use generic colors—stick to turf green, dark green, white, black, and football elements.**
